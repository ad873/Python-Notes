Returning Nested Functions\n","\n","### Returning Nested Functions from Outer Functions\n","Nested functions can be returned as function objects from the outer function. This allows you to create functions with specific behavior based on arguments passed to the outer function.\n","\n","### Assigning Nested Functions to Variables\n","You can assign the returned nested functions to variables, enabling you to use these variables as function objects for invoking the nested functions.\n","\n","### Invoking Nested Functions\n","After assigning the nested function to a variable, you can invoke it like any regular function by using the variable name followed by parentheses and arguments.\n","\n","## 5. Advantages of Nested Functions\n","\n","### Code Encapsulation and Modularity\n","Nested functions allow you to encapsulate functionality within the outer function, promoting better code organization and modular design.\n","\n","### Readability and Organized Code\n","Nested functions can lead to more readable code by keeping related functions close to the context where they are used.\n","\n","### Promoting Code Reusability\n","By defining helper functions within the scope of the outer function, nested functions facilitate code reusability and promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.\n","\n","## 6. Best Practices and Considerations\n","\n","### Avoiding Excessive Nesting\n","Excessive nesting can lead to code complexity and reduced readability. Use nested functions judiciously and consider using local functions or classes for more complex scenarios.\n","\n","### Nested Functions vs. Local Functions\n","In some cases, local functions (functions defined within a module but not within another function) may be more appropriate than nested functions. Consider the context and design requirements when choosing between nested and local functions.\n","\n","### Performance Considerations\n","While nested functions are a powerful feature, keep in mind that they can have performance implications, especially when dealing with a large number of nested function calls. Always consider the performance impact of using nested functions in your code.\n","\n","Nested functions provide a versatile and powerful way to organize and structure your code in Python. They are particularly useful for creating closures, implementing helper functions, and maintaining state within functions. However, like any programming feature, it's essential to use nested functions thoughtfully and in a way that enhances code readability and maintainability."],"metadata":{"id":"W_ttF4Au5fKQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1. **Memoization using Nested Functions**:\n","   Memoization is a technique to optimize functions by caching their results for specific inputs, avoiding redundant computations.
